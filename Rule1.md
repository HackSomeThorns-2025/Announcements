# 🔧 Rule 1 – “Your repo should not look like a junk drawer.”
> Let’s keep it clean. If a recruiter opens your repository, they should say “Wow”, not “Why?”

## 🗂️ Repository Structure Requirement (Deadline: EOD Monday [except for the documentaion pdf])

For Day 1, structure your GitHub repository in a clean, professional, and industry-standard way.

Your repository **must** include the following:

Repo/
│
├── Ideation_PPT/
│ └── round1_submission.pdf
│
├── README.md
│ └── Must include:
│ - Project description
│ - Setup instructions
│ - Tech stack used
│ - Dependencies
│ - Team details
│ - Workflow explanation/diagram
│ - Important external links (if any)
│
├── <ProjectName>/
│ └── Source code here
│ - Do NOT include large folders like node_modules, .dart_tool, etc.
│ - Use proper .gitignore
│ - Use .env files for API keys (never push real keys)
│
└── Documentation/
└── research_paper.pdf (Follow IEEE-conf template on Overleaf)

---

## 🌱 Branch Naming Convention

Use consistent branch names:(examples)
- `feature/<feature-name>`
- `fix/<bug-description>`
- `doc/<section-name>`

---

## Reminders
- Avoid unnecessary binaries or bulky folders.
- Push clean and relevant commits daily.
- Your `README.md` should be self-explanatory and neat.
- The research paper is **mandatory** and should follow the IEEE template.
- Use `.env` and `.gitignore` properly.
- This rule is **non-reversible** – must remain structured until the final submission.

---

**Failure to follow this structure will result in deduction of points.**  
Treat your repo like your resume — keep it clean, sharp, and professional.
