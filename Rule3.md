###  Rule 3 – Animate. Elevate. Captivate.

> "Static UI is so 2010."

This round, we want to see *animations or interactive graphics* in your project. Not just functionality — we’re looking for flair.

Need inspiration? Try these:

* [https://bruno-simon.com/](https://bruno-simon.com)
* [https://madebyreckless.com/](https://madebyreckless.com)
* [https://linear.app/](https://linear.app)
* [https://pitch.com/](https://pitch.com)

(Yeah... those first ones? Chill. Just kidding.)

We’re not asking for 3D physics — just *polished, meaningful interactions* like:

* Smooth transitions
* Hover effects
* Scroll-based animations
* Loading states
* Lottie / Framer Motion / CSS animations

---

*Deadline: EOD Wednesday*

Final projects must retain your animations for scoring.
In a rule3.txt in the documentation folder, mention where the codes/resources for the animations/graphics are added
Do the same for Rule2 too 
Keep it elegant, don’t overdo it — we’re judging creativity, not chaos.
