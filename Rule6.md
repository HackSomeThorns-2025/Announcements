### Rule 6: Product Demo as a Promotional Video

Each team must create a short **promotional video** that presents their project like a product advertisement.

The goal is to convey:
- What your product does
- Who it's for
- Why it’s impressive or unique

The video should feel like a **product launch teaser**, similar in tone to how Apple or Linear showcase their products.

---

#### Guidelines
- Duration: **30 to 90 seconds**
- Format: MP4 or YouTube/Drive link (unlisted is fine)
- Focus on **visuals, flow, experience** — not explanations or voiceovers (optional)
- Use motion, music, or animation to convey your product's strengths

> The video should be something you’d proudly share on a website or launch page.

---

#### Submission Deadline
- Submit the video by **Sunday, June 22 – EOD**
- Include the link or video file in your GitHub repo under:
```
/documentation/demo.mp4
```
or add a `demo.txt` with the shareable link.

---

This demo will be part of your final evaluation and can significantly influence the **Design** and **Business Model** categories.
