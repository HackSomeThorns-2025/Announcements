### Rule 5: Minimum Test Requirement (Deadline: EOD Friday)

Each team is required to include **at least one test** that verifies the functionality of a key feature in their project.

This test may be:
- A unit test (e.g., using Jest, Pytest, etc.)
- A frontend interaction test (e.g., using Cypress or React Testing Library)
- An API or backend test
- A validation script that checks the format or correctness of an exported file or output

The goal of this rule is to encourage teams to validate the reliability and correctness of their implementation through basic testing practices.

#### Documentation Requirement

Create a file named `rule5.txt` inside your `documentation` folder. This file must clearly mention:
- The feature being tested
- The type of test implemented
- The file path where the test is located
- Instructions to run the test
