## Rule 4: Make it Shareable

Your project **must allow users to export or share something meaningful** from their interaction with your product.

This can include:
- Exporting data/results as PDF, image, CSV, JSON, etc.
- Sharing a personalized output (e.g., a report, badge, summary screen)
- Generating a public preview link or social media post

> The goal is to **extend the usefulness of your product beyond the app itself** — make it easy for users to save, show, or send something they've created or seen inside your product.

#### 📁 Documentation Requirement:
Create a file named `rule4.txt` inside your `documentation` folder.

This file should:
- Briefly explain **what export/share feature** you've added
- Mention **where in the app** it can be accessed
- List **which files/components** were changed or added for this feature
